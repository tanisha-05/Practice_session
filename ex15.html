  <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 
    (T20) cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based
    franchise teams. The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. It has an 
    exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring 
    during the IPL seasons.</p>

  <p>On 13 September 2007, following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[26] the BCCI announced a franchise
     based Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled to
      start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-President Lalit Modi,
       who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, 
       franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. </p>
