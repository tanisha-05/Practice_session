        <a href="#BOI">Birth of the Internet</a>
    <p>A network is a group of connected, communicating devices such as computers and
printers. An internet (note the lowercase i) is two or more networks that can communicate
with each other. The most notable internet is called the Internet (uppercase I ),
composed of hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks. Private individuals as
well as various organizations such as government agencies, schools, research facilities,
corporations, and libraries in more than 100 countries use the Internet. Millions
of people are users. Yet this extraordinary communication system only came into being
in 1969.</p>
<li><h2>ARPANET</h2></li>
<p>In the mid-1960s, mainframe computers in research organizations were stand-alone
devices. Computers from different manufacturers were unable to communicate with
one another. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the Department of
Defense (DOD) was interested in finding a way to connect computers together so that
the researchers they funded could share their findings, thereby reducing costs and eliminating
duplication of effort.</p>

<p>In 1967, at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) meeting, ARPA presented
its ideas for ARPANET, a small network of connected computers. The idea was
that each host computer (not necessarily from the same manufacturer) would be
attached to a specialized computer, called an interface message processor (IMP). The
IMPs, in turn, would be connected to each other. Each IMP had to be able to communicate
with other IMPs as well as with its own attached host.</p>
<p>By 1969, ARPANET was a reality. Four nodes, at the University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), and the University of Utah, were connected via the IMPs to
form a network. Software called the Network Control Protocol (NCP) provided communication
between the hosts.</p>

<li><h2>Birth of the Internet</h2></li>
In 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core ARPANET
group, collaborated on what they called the Internetting Project. They wanted to link
different networks together so that a host on one network could communicate with a
host on a second, different network. There were many problems to overcome: diverse
packet sizes, diverse interfaces, and diverse transmission rates, as well as differing
reliability requirements. Cerf and Kahn devised the idea of a device called a gateway to
serve as the intermediary hardware to transfer data from one network to another
